# Implemted what i learned from Andrew NG Courses

1. i picked logistic regression with gradient descent
2. Instead of implement the pretrained models i hardcoded like i had to learn in the courses, this helps to understand the core concepts and why and what to use
3. But how it works is basically 1. go forward throug the model then compute the cost so check
   how wrong the prediction are, and then we go backwards and adjust the weights to reduce the cost
   that happens in my propagate function
4.
